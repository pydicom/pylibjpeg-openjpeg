.. _v2.4.0:

2.4.0
=====

Changes
.......

* Fixed decoding and encoding failures when running on big endian systems.
* Supported Python versions are 3.9 to 3.13.
* NumPy < 2.0 is no longer supported.
* Switched to OpenJpeg v2.5.2

Known Issues
------------

* OpenJpeg seems to be unable to correctly encode image data with more than 16-bit
  precision when running on big endian systems
* Encoding images on little endian systems works with up to 24-bit precision, but the
  results for lossy encoding can be extremely poor for more than 20+ bits.
